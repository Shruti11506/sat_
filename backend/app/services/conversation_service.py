"""Business logic for the conversations resource.

A conversation groups a chat's uploads (imagery.conversation_id) and queries
(analysis_jobs.conversation_id). Title rules:

* A new conversation is titled "New Chat" (title_source "default").
* Uploading files never changes the title.
* `generate_title` sets the title ONCE from the conversation's first
  meaningful query (title_source "auto"), and is a no-op afterwards.
* A manual rename sets title_source "user"; it is never overwritten.
